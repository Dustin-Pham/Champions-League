# Champions-League

## Goal
The goal of this project was to display my knowledge and skills of python and Tableau. I wanted to showcase my skills in data cleaning and data visualization.

## Process
I first imported the data over the champions league from sportsvizsunday. After importing Pandas and Numpy, I wanted to see what i was working with. I realized that there was too many unecessary columns so i decided to drop the ones that werent necessary. 

After droping some of the columns, I chose to save some of the new data that had the potential to help create data visualization.

Using the mean, I searched the attendance above the mean. The reason is because I wanted to see if the attendance were to do particularly better depending on who was in final, and where the final was lcoated at.

(By downloading the code, you can see more in depth on how I cleaned and searched my data.)

After I collecting all the data that was necessary, I imported the data into Tableau were I created 3 charts. These 3 charts summarized the whole champions league. I icluded the ratio of the goals scored and who won each year in one chart. I created a chart that showed the number of attendance each year, and the teams that were competing. Lastly I created a chart that showed each team that has won the league and the amount of times they won.
